# Recipe AI

This is the final project AI for the Building AI (Elements of AI) course.

## Summary

The idea is a simple AI application that recommends recipe based on your alimentation behaviour. It uses your past meals and those from other users to recommend meals for the week.

## Background

The main problem is the lack of idea/inspiration when planning the food for the week. As I find myself often eating pasta and rice (too often), I wanted to create a tool that could help me eat more creative and diverse meals. This is a really frequent problem as we face it at least every week. To me, it's an important topic, cause it helps people eat better, more diverse, and might even motivate one's to cook.

## How is it used?

I would see the programm embedded in an Android/iOS application for better and healthier food. But at the moment, my goal is to develop a simple tool using AI method. I don't want to make profit or anything related. It is very likely that similar applications already exist, with full monetization et caetera, and that's not my point.


## Data sources and AI methods

Hopefully I can extract data from another service or application. Marmiton, for example, is a website that hosts cooking recipes. Then it will be my job to create users profiles and other data schemes.

Talking technical, the tool should use simple solutions :
* Nearest Neighbours method - helps identify similar profiles in order to recommend recipes liked by others.
* Unsupervised machine learning methods - because I want to try, and packing recipes in categories would be very useful.

## Challenges

As this is a really simple tool, it should solve only the task it was built for. If it fits correctly, then the job will be complete. I can't see any limitations here.

## What next?

The project could become a real Android/iOS application, get a monetization system, and make profits. But once again, this is far from being my goal. I just want to improve my skills with building AI tools.
